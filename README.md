# Manufacturing Equipment Log File Analysis Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This is for Forward School ADS Capstone Project, where I'm using internal system logging to find out the most uncommon sentences in the whole logs.
Assumption is made such that whenever there is an incident, the logging will contain uncommon sentences and will speed up the recovery process.

This solution is not open for public use yet, as it only applies to internal logging with certain structure.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
